This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving undefined behavior when using raw pointers with vectors. The `bug.rs` file contains the problematic code, which modifies a vector through a raw pointer after the vector has been dropped. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version, using safe Rust techniques and avoiding the use of raw pointers whenever possible.
